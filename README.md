# Intelligent-Humidistat
I did this project as a part of the course Microprocessors & Interfacing Course (EEE F241) at BITS Pilani, Goa Campus in my second year. The repository contains the assembly code, detailed report file (along with hand-made drawings showing all connections and the complete hardware design), the Proteus design file and the concerning sensor manuals used.
